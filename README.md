## Project Title
Employee Generator

## Description
This is a command line application which prompts the user for information about the team manager, and team members. The user can input as many team members as they would like. Once the user chooses to not add anymore team members the app will stop running and will create an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster.

## Installation
This is a command line application and it is run as a Node CLI. I leveraged node modules, npm inquirer and jest. It was super important to also keep my file structure very clean and well organized.

## Usage 
This was a backend termianl CLI project which required the backend to talk to the front end. This project prompted the user for data which created employee objects. These employee objects were passed into an array of employees which we then printed out to the front end HTML page.
